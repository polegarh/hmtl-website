								<h3>GoFind XR</h3>

								<p> GoFind XR is a startup that was founded in Toronto, CA, but it has employees all over the world, such as Singapore, USA, 
									Russia and more. Thus, most of its work is done in small remote teams. 
								</p>

								<p>	I helped GoFind XR to rebrand its website and online identity by recreating the website from a bought template. 
									Furthermore, I helped with hosting the website, securing the connection, updating content, translating the website, 
									deploying changes and several other small tasks. In addition I was always avaliable to help out other teams where the help was needed. 
									In general, my time in GoFind XR was not fulltime, since I was enrolled in University fulltime. 
									However, even with university classes under my belt, I was always helpful to GoFind XR as I made changes daily at times. 
								</p>

								<p>
									This internship has helped me a lot in being more confident about myself and my tecnical abilities. 
									I thank everyone at GoFind XR for such incredible opportunity for growth, especially Manindra, as I was working with him daily. 
								</p>

								<h3>Luggage Teleport</h3>

								<p> Luggage Teleport is a startup that was founded in Palo Alto, CA, but has offices in San Francisco, CA and Singapore.</p>

								<p> There, I worked as a full stack software developer. I have dealt with multiple problems ranging from fixing
									Design flaws to working with in AWS console. This internship has taught me a lot to say the least. 
									Not only did I have a great responsibility, but I also had little to no help which forced me to learn more than 
									I would ever have at any other job. Starting from React, which was a completely new tool for me when I got to Luggage Teleport, 
									I had no one to mentor me through this, so I had to stay focused and dedicated in order to fit in and help the team as soon as possible.
								</p>

								<p>
									Technecalities aside, I have also learned a lot about San Francisco and the Silicon Valley
									that we all know about, but only the lucky ones get to be there. In fact, after attending
									multiple networking events, such as Internapalooza Tech Fair, in this amazing city with
									several well known companies such as Samsara, Stripe, Slack, Jumpstart, Atlassian, and Affirm
									I have realized how techy people are here in this city.
								</p>

								<p>
									That fact alone has taught me a lot during my internhsip at Luggage Teleport. The mindset
									this experince has put me in is invaluble and for that alone I want to thank Luggage Teleport.
								</p>

								<p>
									If anyone from Luggage Teleport is reading this, I want to sincerely thank you for this experience.
									I think everyone in the team was awesome and I really have learned a lot.

								<h3>CDB Systems</h3>

								<p>CDB Systems is a small company from Chicago, IL.</p>

								<p>During my two month unpaid internship in CDB Systems I was fortunate to work alongside amazing people 
								   who taught me a lot of useful skills that I use to this day. Durinf this internship, I created a website from scratch using a template and WordPress.
								   I have also implemented the cloud service of the website using AWS (EC2, ELB, RDS). In addition, 
								   I have also created and updated the database using PHP and SQL. Finally, I was responsible for maintaining the Website and work on SEO for the website.
								</p>
								<p>I thank everyone in CDB System for giving me a chance to kickstart my career!</p>
