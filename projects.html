									<h4>Kubernetes</h4>
									<p> I have spent over several months learning about Kuberentes and preparing for CKAD exam.  
									    I started this journey as I discovered a gap in my understanding of cloud based applications 
									    and I wanted to become a well-rounded software engineer who can design a scalable, cloud based application, 
									    and then also develop the backend, frontend. Then finally, connect all of these pieces together using Docker and Kuberntes.  
									    I believe that I have defintely filled the gap, but with more experience in building such application I can then fully master it. 
									    Although, the work that went to this journey is a lot more than just one application, I think it is still important to take a look 
                                                                            at what I am able to achieve now with my own bare hands as you can see on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/"> repository. </a>

									<h4>Kafka </h4>
									<p> I have created a simple Kafka Demo in Java. This program is able to read a text file, convert each line to a JSON object. 
									Then this object is sent to Kafka topic, and eventually received by a different program that stores these objects in the local oracle database through jdbc.  
									If you would like to learn more about this, please go to <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/Simple-Kafka-Example">this</a> GitHub Repository.

									<h4>HashTag Creator – IOS App</h4>
									<p> I have created a IOS app that is based on Machine Learning Models from Apple. In this app 
										the user may upload or take a photo and then the app will guess what is in this 
										picture, and then it will give top 10 hashtags for this prediction. Please take 
										a look at my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/hashtag-generator"> repository </a> if you would like to know more.

									<h4>Poker Help – Alexa Skill</h4>
									<p> I wrote an Alexa skill by utilizing Lambda in AWS. This skill allows the user 
										to ask Alexa whether they should keep or fold their hand in Poker. This project 
										was done during the Hackathon. If you would like to learn more about this, 
										please visit my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/alexa-skill-poker"> repository </a> .

									<h4>Name Generator</h4>
									<p> I have created an application that can return novel male and female names based on
										the dataset of 2,000 unique names. The way my application can generate new names is 
										based on Markov Model. If you would like to learn more about this, 
										please visit my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/name-generator"> repository </a> .

									<h4>Eight Puzzle</h4>
									<p> I have created an Goal based Agent, that will solve the Eight Puzzle
										given the randomized array of numbers. To be more specific this application 
										will take an array of numbers such as [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 8, 7, 6, 0] and will change 
										the order of numbers until it reaches the goal of [1, 2, 3, 8, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5]. 
										If you would like to learn more about this, please go to <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/eight-puzzle">this</a> GitHub Repository.

									<h4>Remote – IOS App</h4>
									<p> I have created a Remote app, which is just a mockup to what a Remote app 
										can look like, since it is not connected to TV anyhow. However, this app 
										still show several important concepts of IOS Development, such as 
										multi-view application where data is shared between each view. In addition, 
										this app also shows the concepts of autolayout. If you would like to learn more about this, 
										please go to <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/remote">this</a> GitHub Repository soon.

									<h4>Football Legends – IOS App</h4>
									<p> I have created a very simple app, that displays several football legends and if clicked for more information
										then it displays a page dedicated to that player showing their photo and their biography.
										If you would like to learn more about this, please visit my GitHub 
										<a href="https://github.com/polegarh/football-legends"> repository </a> .

									<h4>Blockchain Project </h4>
									<p> This was my Senior Capstone Porject, where I was part of 7 Man Team, in which 
										I was responsible for Collaboration Software, Planning, Testing and Implementation roles. 
										This project was a Blockchain based on Health Records. By the end of this project, we
										were able to show a command line interface blockchain, which was ran on multiple servers. 
										On top of that, we have built a frontend, which was a React JS App. If you would like to 
										learn more about this, you may look at github repository about command line interface 
										<a href="https://github.com/Alexis-Falquier/dominoes"> here </a> and repository about front end 
										<a href="https://github.com/polegarh/dominoes-front"> here </a> .

									<h4>Scala Mini Compiler</h4>
									<p> Wrote a mini lisp compiler in scala. This project included hands on experience on 
										several topics such as, AST, parsing, and assembly language, as well as minimal 
										understanding of lisp. If you would like to learn more about this, you may look at 
										github repository <a href="https://github.com/polegarh/Lisp_Compiler_in_Scala"> here </a> .
